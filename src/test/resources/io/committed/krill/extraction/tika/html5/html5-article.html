		<h1>Comprehensive HTML5 document</h1>
	</header>
	<p>This document contains comprehensive coverage of HTML5 tags and, to a lesser extent their attributes. It is intended as a demonstration of the document structures we expect to be able to annotate.</p>
	<footer>
		<p>This document does not exhaustively document HTML5, but it should cover the major structural elements commonly seen in the wild. It notably does not include form elements.</p>
