	<h2>Inline elements</h2>
	<p>Some elements, such as <span id="spans">can be used to define elements within other elements</span>. Other inline tags include <a id="anchor">anchors</a> which can also be used as <a href="#anchor">links to content</a>, though it is also possible to link to elements by id (such as the <a href="#spans">previous span</a>). Images, <a href="#images">such as those at the end of the document</a>, are also defined using inline tags.</p>
	<p>It is also possible to logically mark up computer code inline using the code tag:</p>
	<blockquote>The main entry point into a C/C++ program is a function called main, which can be defined as either <code>int main(void)</code> or <code>int main(int argc, char* argv[])</code>. This can be logically rewritten as <code>int main(int argc, char** argv)</code>. Some platforms (POSIX, and hence Unix/Windows) add the environment <code>int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)</code> as a way to internalise <code>extern char **environ</code>. On Darwin/OSX add additional parameters are provided through the <code>apple</code> argument of the entry point <code>int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp, char **apple)</code> - for example, <code>apple[0]</code>contains the path to the currently executing binary (not necessarily the same as the value of <code>argv[0]</code> since this can be set to any arbitrary value by <code>execve(2)</code>).
