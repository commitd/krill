	<h2>Horizontal breaks, quotes, et al.</h2>
	<p>It can be sometimes desirable to insert a horizontal rule into the document. One could argue this is style best reserved for CSS, but others argue it is a structural element in its own right.</p>
	<hr />
	<p>It appears that structure won as this section has a different theme (HTML5 defines hr as a 'thematic break'). We demonstrate the different types of quote:</p>
	<h3>Citation</h3>
	<cite>This is a citation from an unknown source.</cite>
	<h3>Blockquote</h3>
	<blockquote cite="some source">
		<p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog 123456780 times.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Inline quotations</h3>
	<p>We can also define <q>Inline quotations, like this one</q> if we so wish.</p>
